    <p class="maintext">Hello, I am Andrew Overbeck! I am currently studying Creative Technologies Game Design and Music at Illinois State University. I was born in Decatur, Il, but have spent most of my life in a small town named Morris, Il. I enjoy playing video/board games, whether it is with family, friends, or even people I have never met before. Throughout this website, you will find many different projects that I have either created on my own or have collaborated with others to make.</p>
